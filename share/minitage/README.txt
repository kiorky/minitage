Minitage is a deployment tool that allows you to forget compilation and other
crasy stuff.
Il will allow you to:

    * Deploy a project from start to end
    * Reproduce the same environement everywhere (on UNIX platforms)
      ( best supported platforms are MacOSX (Leopard required) and Linux)
    * Isolate all the needed boilerplate from the host system
    * Control all the build process.
    * Fix buildout leaks :) or at least try to.

It is licensed under the GPL-2 license.

    * on irc : #minitage @ irc.freenode.net
